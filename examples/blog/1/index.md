We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. See there how easy that is. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.

And maybe, `maybe`, maybe... You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let's get wild today.

```ts
const myGreeter = new Greeter('hello, world')
myGreeter.greeting = 'howdy'
myGreeter.showGreeting()

class SpecialGreeter extends Greeter {
    constructor() {
        super(
            `Isn't that fantastic? Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.`
        )
    }
}
```

> Working it up and down, _back and forth_. Talk to trees, **look at the birds**. Whatever it takes. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.

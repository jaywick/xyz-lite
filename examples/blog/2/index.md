Just make little strokes like that. Let your heart be your guide. We'll put a happy little sky in here. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. You need to have a very firm paint to do this.

Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Trees grow however makes them happy. This painting comes right out of your heart.

Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. We can fix anything. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy.

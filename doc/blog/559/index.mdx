I started using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) the other day and now I can't get enough of it. It's basically `yum` or `apt-get` but for PC. It handles installation, upgrade, uninstallation as well as dependencies between packages! No need to enable multiple updater services and best of all no more 20 clicks to find the latest download! Check out the following commands:

****

Want the latest version of VLC? Just run

    choco install vlc

What to upgrade it?

    choco upgrade vlc

And when it's time to uninstall you'd just enter

    choco uninstall vlc

Time to upgrade everything you install via choco?

    choco upgrade all --confirm

Of course you'll first have to install Chocolatey first by running this in the command prompt.

    @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin

### Chromium and Flash

From the featured pic, you'll note I'm using Chromium over Chrome. One annoyance is that you will have to install the new PepperFlash (uses the PPAPI) plugin now that [NPAPI is deprecated](https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation). You can get Flash working on Chromium for Windows through Flash Player 18 Beta which is currently available via [Adobe Labs](https://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer.html).

### My Apps

I'd love to get my stuff like [Vizr](/portfolio/vizr) and [Kalq](/portfolio/kalq) added as packages soon. But in the mean time here's a list of apps I recommend in the form of a `choco install` batch script.

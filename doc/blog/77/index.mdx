Kinetic Typography is a beautiful animation which involves flying text stylised to echo the meaning behind the words. The videos are usually short, and the effort it takes to make them are usually long.

I clocked in about 54 hours making this 74 second clip, for some reason staying home awake most nights made more sense than going out and buying a card. But it was oh so worth it in the end! <3 Happy birthday babe!

So, how on earth is this made?

****

What you’d be using is Adobe AfterEffects for real 3D movement and other effects. But I didn’t have that, so what I used was an old Flash I had installed.

But it’s not the tools that matter, its all about imagination. There’s no "create rotating sun here" command or "make a tree grow" action. You have to manually make the circles, words, lines, rotations and movements by yourself.

Complex logical problems and the need for creativity? I love nothing better than giving both hemispheres the exercise. 

# Some other vids worth watching

## [The Game (Official Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asvtgj6wANw)

*By Prince Ea ft. Sha Stimuli (note: contains a few cusses)*

## [Nothin' On You (another Bruno Mars vid)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GIri18rLoc)

*Note the 'i' I've tried to emulate using Flash*

## [Dark Knight (Joker Speech)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL2IIpNkSKs)

*This one is done very well. Perfectly "echoes the meaning behinds the words"*

## [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yG4DJyrnPI)

*My personal favourite, but not based on speech*

# In the future

I loved making this video and hopefully I'll learn some AfterEffects and do another one!

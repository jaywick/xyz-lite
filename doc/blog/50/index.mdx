â€‹Android 4.2 Jelly Bean introduced a neat feature called [Daydreams](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Feature-Android-4.2-Daydream-mode_id36641), which are screensavers for your device while they are docked or charging.

I designed *It Is Time*, a simple and minimalist daydream which displays the current time in words. So basically instead of 11:52 you'll see "eleven fifty two".

Here's the Google Play link...

To enable go to *Settings > Display > Daydream*. Enable Daydreams and choose the app. You can access the Settings from the icon on right of the listing to tweak it to your liking.

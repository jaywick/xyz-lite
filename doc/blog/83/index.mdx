How many times have you wanted a window to be on top of the screen while you do something else with another.

You can get that little Pin icon on your windows through the free version of [DisplayFusion](https://www.displayfusion.com/). There are other features such as multi monitor taskbars that even work with Windows 7 and extends the wallpaper shuffling features and keeps the native smooth fade transitions other similar programs lose. Some of these features are not free however.

# Setting it up

1. Download DisplayFusion from here [https://www.displayfusion.com/Download/](https://www.displayfusion.com/Download/)
2. Right click it's system tray icon then click **Settings**
3. Click the *TitleBar Buttons* side tab on the left
4. Have *Enable TitleBar Buttons* checked
5. Click **Add**
6. In the new window, under *TitleBar Button Action* find _Toggle Window Always on Top_
7. **Okay** your self out of there, and you're done

You could also achieve this with an [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script as simple as:

```autohotkey
#a::WinSet, AlwaysOnTop, TOGGLE, A   
```

Which sets your window on top with the press of <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>

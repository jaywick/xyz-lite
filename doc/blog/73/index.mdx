It’s been a few months since I [started](/blog/81/if-you-want-it-done-right-do-it-yourself/) the making [my own jet fighter game](/portfolio/blackstorm-alpha).

From [buying joysticks](/blog/78/new-joystick-a-new-video/), to [testing missiles](/blog/79/a-new-world/), [realising sketches](/75/procrastinate-by-doing-something-productive/) to [designing jets](/74/will-it-blend/), it has been pretty fun. So I guess a good update has been long overdue.

****

I redid the entire game to get rid of inexplicable frame rate drops, which is why it looks similar to the last one. The jet you’re seeing is the [F77 Variant](/blog/74/will-it-blend/). The terrain is a massive 25 x 25km map with 1.6km of sky. Towards the last third of the video you'll see a new enemy AI script I cooked up which accurately and realistically follows the player around. You'll also note missiles do absolutely nothing but fly through and around the target, it’s not a bug. I just disabled collision detection for testing and lengthening the flight.

Thanks for watching! Next up, you can expect explosions, new weapons and enemies that will actually fight back!

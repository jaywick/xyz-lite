I was part of a large team chosen to setup a robot factory that would deliver casino chips into a tray and store them. While it sounded simple, it took weeks of design before development even commenced.

As part of the team in charge of the robot arms, we spent many nights in the lab prototyping, report writing and sleeping. The pure effort we put into this meant we all became good friends, appreciating each others efforts and going out of our way to help each other with their own issues.

The project was to be of the highest standard with strict compliance to many protocols including IEEE 830 / IEEE 1233. We successfully delivered the project on time, despite discovering some integration issues at 2AM of the due date.

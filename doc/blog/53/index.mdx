We learn so much from the experience of others â€“ the tricks, the gotcha's, the workarounds. Back in my first job as a junior software dev, it was my mentor who taught me to give back to the community from which I learnt so much.

Labs is the initiative to bring these projects to light. The slogan "Exploring crazy ideas because we can" epitomises my passion to work on such projects. It's not for any reason greater than *'hey let's see what happens'*. And just maybe someone will find use for what I find along the way.

I don't know why but I love coding while it's raining outside. Chai latte + laptop + raining outside + feet up = my ideal workstation. Thought that could be a good photo for this entire thing!

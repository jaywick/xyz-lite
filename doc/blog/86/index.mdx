Microsoft secretly removed the Smart DJ feature along with a few other things in the new Zune 4.2 update for international users. I'm Australian and scouring the www, it looks like we're the hardest hit.

If your Zune is missing Smart DJ then you're one of the many people of a non-US country whose existence Microsoft is unaware of. Luckily you can re-enable these features and more.

Have a read through and download the registry file and run it:  
 [https://www.withinwindows.com/2009/09/17/restore-zune-4-0s-missing-features/](https://www.withinwindows.com/2009/09/17/restore-zune-4-0s-missing-features/ "https://www.withinwindows.com/2009/09/17/restore-zune-4-0s-missing-features/")

The above link will get you working with all the hidden features, but SmartDJ was not included in that article (at time of publishing), so try doing the following:

Add a DWORD (32bit) with name `QuickMixLocal` and set its value to 1. This goes in the same place as the other feature overrides described in the above linked article.

This SmartDJ hack was discovered by registry ninja EwanD (see post ‘01-28-2010, 8:03 PM’) in [https://forums.zune.net/0/2/574548/ShowPost.aspx#574548](https://forums.zune.net/0/2/574548/ShowPost.aspx#574548)

We thank you again, collective people of the internet.

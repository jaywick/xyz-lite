Whilst scouring my old hard drives looking for lost home videos, I uncovered this little gem back from my childhood.

****

*Universe in Hand* was a little particle simulator game which initially grew from my curiosity of the laws of gravitation to the simple idea that I could simulate the universe! Enjoy the video, I added some music I thought captured the innocence and simplicity of days gone by.

Another one for the portfolio! https://jaywick.xyz/portfolio/universe-in-hand

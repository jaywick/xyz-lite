YouTube, out of nowhere, removed the star rating system which they believed was too ambiguous and useless, and opted for the *simpler* Like / Dislike system.

I have to admit this is a horrible change. It was via ratings that we knew what was worth watching, what was fake, what was boring or what was awesome. Now that it's gone you got nothing.

Thankfully there's a Firefox add-on to rid you of your worries that will add the correct star rating to where it used to be.
